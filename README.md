# Blue Cloud Travel Agency (Fictional)

Developed a website as part of an academic project during my studies at Hellenic Mediterranean University. The website was designed to showcase various travel packages with a user-friendly interface, enabling users to browse available trips and place orders. Additionally, the platform included a user registration system, allowing users to create accounts, book travel packages, and manage their bookings efficiently.
